        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>
            We are a team of researchers from the University of Turin, the EPFL and the Wikimedia Foundation. 
            We are conducting research on how people read Wikipedia articles.
            <br>We would like you to participate in this research by completing the following tasks that simulate information seeking behavior on Wikipedia.
            While reading articles, a webcam-based eye-tracking tool will record your eye position on the screen anonymously. 
            The tasks will require approximately 20-30 minutes to complete.
            <br>Thank you for taking some of your precious time! 
            You are providing us with some very useful data for our research, and we hope you will learn some interesting Wikipedia facts too!
        </p>
        <p>
            Each task is easy:
            <ul>
                <li>You are given a Wikipedia article and a question to answer.</li>
                <li>The answer can be found in any textual or visual part of the article: written paragraphs, captions, images, etc.</li>
                <li>Of course, some questions could be more difficult than others to answer. We do not require you to be as quick as possible â€” take your time!</li>
                <li>Once you find the answer, just type it into the text box on top of the browser window.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Important:</b> This experiment involves the use of an <a href="https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">eye-tracking sofware</a>.
            While reading the article, your webcam keeps track of your eye positions on the screen as <i>(x, y)</i> coordinates. 
            This data is collected anonymously and for the purpose of this research only.
