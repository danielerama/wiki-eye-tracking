Using eye-tracking on Wikipedia articles

To do:
* get HTML element in Wiki page (in iframe) from gaze coordinates
* ~~save data as json~~
  * --> jQuery AJAX
* ~~extract browser window size~~
  * set canvas and adjust its width / height according to window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight
* keep track of session / user
* (keep track of visited Wikipedia pages -- depends on the experiment)
